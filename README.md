Practical Task: Programming for Data Analysis


The following assignment in this repository concerns the numpy.random package in Python. 
I was required to create a Jupyter Notebook explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package. 

There are four distinct tasks that were carried out in my Jupyter Notebook. 

1) Explanation of the overall purpose of the package. 
2) Explanation of the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions. 
3) Explanation of the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions. 
4) Explanation of the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers

The final part of this task was to compare the Mersenne Twister RNG to the new PCG64 and to discuss how the PCG64 outperforms the MT RNG. 


How to Run the Jupyter Notebook:

1) Open the terminal on your Mac or PC
2) Navigate to the folder where your project is stored
3) Type Jupyter Notebook and press ‘Enter’
4) A browser will appear that will show a .ipynb document
5) Double-click on the .ipynb document and another tab will open with the Jupyter Notebook
6) Begin reading/working in your Jupyter Notebook
